# Operating_Systems
Two small exercises assigned to us within the course of Operating Systems, during the third semester.

The first program implements the creation of four threads, and their synchronization using semaphores, visualized by the indefinite printing of a phrase.

The second program creates a tree-like hierarchy of processes using fork() calls, and prints their process IDs and parent process IDs. At the end, the parent process executes the cat command to display the source code of the first program.
